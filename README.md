# Project Ubanze
 

UBANZE is a Django-based project designed to connect users with service providers in their local area, neighborhood, or even around the corner. This platform allows individuals to showcase their services, including what they can do, what they sell, and what they offer, creating a community-driven hub for local service exchange. The project focuses specifically on services within UBANsâ€”the Georgian word for "Area"â€”emphasizing hyper-local connections and accessibility.

    Additionally, the application supports Basic Authentication for secure access to the
    API endpoints in the Django REST Framework.
